//TEST CASES

// No numbers are provided: Easy. It should just not beep at all and end immediately since no beeps should get scheduled.
// An input is a negative number: Ignore/skip any numbers that are negative. We can't schedule anything in the past.
// An input is not a number: Ignore/skip these as well, instead of attempting to call setTimeout with a non-number.
